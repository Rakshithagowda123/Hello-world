<h3><p><h2>Step 1 Chop green chillies & ginger</h2>
Take out a chopping board and chop green chillies, ginger, 
garlic and keep aside. Then, take a deep bottomed pan and put chana dal in it.
<h2>Step 2 Saute chana dal, boneless chicken pieces with spices</h2>
Saute dal until tender. Once done, keep aside. Next, add boneless
 chicken thigh pieces to the same pan. Add a sufficient amount of water
 along with salt, both red chillies, cloves, black pepper,
 cinnamon sticks, cumin and carom seeds. Turn the flame to medium-low
 and allow it to simmer until the chicken is thoroughly cooked.
 Once done, add half of the egg along with chopped coriander, mint,
 green chillies, ginger and garlic. Mix well and give a thick dough-like
 texture to the prepared mixture.
<h2>Step 3 Shape the kebabs and pan fry</h2>
Once done, make small balls from the mixture and flatten them further.
 Give them a round shape of that of Tikki. Next, place a pan on medium flame,
 add refined oil and dip the kebabs in the remaining eggs. 
Then pan-fry them until golden brown.
<h2>Step 4 Serve hot</h2>
Once well-cooked and crispy enough, take out and serve the Chicken kebabs 
with any chutney of your choice. Do try this recipe, rate it and leave
